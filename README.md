# About

This project is educational, meaning I added libraries/tools to it just for the purpose of playing with them.

Stack :
* Gradle Kotlin DSL
* Spring Boot 2.X
* Spring Cloud Contracts
* Spring RestDocs
* JSON Schema (Everit-org)
* Lombok
* Create React App
* Embedded Mongo
* Docker

Features :
* Create React App "build" task linked to Gradle workflow (could have added the "test" task as well)
* Examples of tests (sometime pointless) on every layer with JUnit, Mockito, RestAssuredMockMvc, AssertJ
* Auto-generation of RestDocs from Contract tests
* Auto-generation of Open API Spec from RestDocs
* Use immutable object between sources of truth (user input <-> database)
* Validation against a simple JSON Schema
* Node, Yarn and Gradle installed locally
* Docker builder
